  title: Frequently Asked Questions about Website Creation
  questions:
    - question: Do you need my content to create my website?
      answer:
        Yes, content (texts, images, videos) is a crucial element for creating
        your website. Ideally, we need the final content as early as possible to
        design and develop the pages efficiently and optimally. We can assist
        you in structuring your content.

    - question: Do you offer help with writing content for my website?
      answer:
        Yes, in addition to creating your site, we can offer you help with
        writing your texts or guide you towards specialized partners to create
        impactful content optimized for the web.

    - question: How long does it take to create a website?
      answer:
        The duration depends on the project’s complexity. Generally, a simple
        showcase website can be completed in 2 to 4 weeks, while a custom
        project can take 4 to 8 weeks.

    - question: Will my site be adapted for mobile phones and tablets?
      answer:
        Absolutely! Responsive design (adaptation to all screen types) is
        essential today. All the websites we create are natively designed to
        offer an optimal user experience on smartphones, tablets, and desktop
        computers.

    - question: Will my site be optimized for search engine optimization (SEO)?

        suitable structure, fast loading times, and optimized content to improve
        your online visibility.

    - question: Can I manage my site myself after its creation?
      answer:
        Yes, if your site is developed on a CMS like Drupal, you will have full
        access to the administration interface to easily manage and update your
        content (texts, images, blog posts, products, etc.) without any
        technical knowledge. We offer training if needed.

    - question: Do you offer website maintenance services after its launch?
      answer:
        Yes, we offer maintenance packages to ensure the security, regular
        updates (CMS, plugins), and continuous performance of your site after
        its launch, allowing you to focus on your main activity.

    - question: What is the cost of a website?
      answer:
        The cost of a website varies depending on its complexity, the number of
        pages, specific functionalities, the desired design, and necessary
        integrations. Each project is unique, which is why we offer personalized
        quotes after fully understanding your needs.
